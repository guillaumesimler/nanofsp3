-- Initialize and select the Database
--
-- Thanks to reviewer n1 for the 
--  * IF EXIST Statement
--  * the simple \c tournament (to select the database, an element I missed so I kicked the 
--    two first lines from an previous not reviewed version)

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS tournament;
CREATE DATABASE tournament;
\c tournament;


-- Tables: please look at the readme and the xls file
CREATE TABLE Register_player (Playername text,
							  starting_tournament integer,
							  Playerid serial PRIMARY KEY);

CREATE TABLE Tournaments (tournamentname text,
						  tournamentid serial PRIMARY KEY);

CREATE TABLE Player (tournament integer REFERENCES Tournaments(tournamentid),
					Playerid integer REFERENCES Register_player);


-- Thanks to reviewer n1 for the correction:
--    I was aware that Player1 and 2 (now winner and loser) were foreign key
--    I thought it was more logical to put on Player. Yet PSQL did not like the 
--    foreign key on a foreign key.

CREATE TABLE Matches (winner integer REFERENCES Register_player(Playerid),
					  loser integer REFERENCES Register_player(Playerid),
					  tournamentid integer REFERENCES Tournaments(tournamentid),
					  tied boolean,
